// Patterns we could use
// Composite Design Pattern: 
// This pattern allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In this case, you could use the pattern to define a basic interface, say, IOrderItem, that includes common methods like getPrice(), getDescription(), getId(), etc. Then, every item sold (entrees, toppings, sauces, etc.) would implement this interface. The Order class could also implement IOrderItem and contain a list of IOrderItem objects.

// Builder Pattern: 
// This is helpful for creating complex objects step by step. It is particularly useful when there is a need to create various types of orders with different combinations of components. The OrderBuilder class could have methods like addEntree(), addTopping(), addSauce(), and finally build() to finalize the order.

// Factory Method or Abstract Factory Pattern: 
// These patterns can help create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. They could be used to instantiate the entrees, toppings, and sauces based on input parameters, allowing for flexibility and extensibility.

// Classes:
// IOrderItem: 
// Interface implemented by all the items and the Order itself.

// Entree, Topping, Sauce: 
// These would be concrete classes implementing IOrderItem interface. They would encapsulate the properties of the specific item.

// Order: 
// Implements IOrderItem, and contains a list of IOrderItem objects. It could provide methods to add items (addItem()), remove items (removeItem()), calculate total price (getTotalPrice()), and so on.

// OrderBuilder: 
// Contains logic for building an Order. Has methods for adding entrees, toppings, sauces, and for finalizing and returning the Order.

// OrderItemFactory: 
// A factory class that creates IOrderItem objects. It could use an identifier or other parameters to determine the type of object to create.

// Techniques:
// Inheritance and Polymorphism: 
// These techniques allow you to define a common interface for various types of items, enabling code reusability and flexibility.

// Encapsulation: 
// By keeping the order details inside the Order class and only allowing them to be modified through methods, you can ensure integrity and consistency.

// Separation of Concerns: 
// Each class has a distinct role. The Order and OrderBuilder classes handle order-related logic, while the OrderItemFactory class handles the creation of individual items.

// Automation and Testing: 
// With the defined classes, it becomes easier to automate and test the system. You can create unit tests for individual item creation, order assembly, and more complex system integration tests to ensure orders are processed correctly.

// Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
// Each class should have a single responsibility, i.e., a class should have only one reason to change. This principle makes the system easier to manage and test.

// Open/Closed Principle (OCP): 
// The system should be open for extension, but closed for modification. That means we can add new types of items or new functionalities without changing the existing code base.
