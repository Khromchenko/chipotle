// The goal of design is to create a detailed plan or blueprint for building software products. 
// While architecture provides a high-level view of the system, 
// design delves into the specifics of how the system will be implemented. 


// Solving User Problems: 
// One of the primary goals of design is to create solutions that solve user problems or meet user needs. Good design should enhance the user's experience and make it easy for them to accomplish their goals.

// Usability and Accessibility: 
// A well-designed system should be easy to use, intuitive, and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

// Efficiency and Performance: 
// Design should consider how to optimize the system for better efficiency and performance. It should aim to minimize resource usage and maximize speed.

// Scalability and Maintainability: 
// The design should allow the system to scale and meet growing demands. It should also facilitate ease of maintenance, so the system can be easily updated or improved over time.

// Consistency and Aesthetics: 
// A well-designed system should provide a consistent user experience across different parts of the system. This includes consistent use of colors, fonts, button styles, etc. Good design also considers aesthetics, which can enhance the overall user experience.

// Reliability and Robustness: 
// Design should consider how the system will handle errors or unexpected inputs, and ensure that the system can recover gracefully from failures.

// Security: 
// Security should be a key consideration in the design process, ensuring that the system is resilient against potential threats and attacks.

// Modularity and Reusability: 
// A good design promotes modularity and reusability, leading to more efficient development and maintenance by enabling components or modules to be reused across different parts of the system or even in different systems.

// Alignment with Business Goals: 
// The design should align with and support the strategic business goals and objectives of the organization.
